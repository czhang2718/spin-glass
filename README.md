Histograms of low energy distribution in Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model.
```cpp
E[i][j] = J[i][j] * spin[i] * spin[j]}
```
E = sum of all E[i][j], i<j.
J is a random variable drawn from normal dist. centered at 0, with standard deviation 6/n^2.
Spins are either 1 or -1.
We look at distribution of counts of spin sequences such that E <= c * sqrt(6/n^2), for fixed n.
